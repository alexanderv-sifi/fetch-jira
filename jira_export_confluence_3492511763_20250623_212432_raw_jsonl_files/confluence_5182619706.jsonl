Click See all settings Once the menu opens, click \"See all settings\" at the top. 3. Scroll to the \"Signature\" Section Click + Create new to make a new signature. Paste your previous signature if you have one from an old email. 4. Set the Signature as Default Under the same section: For new emails use: Select your new signature On reply/forward use: Select your new signature again and You’re all Done! Just Some Reminders Clearing cache doesn’t resolve this issue. This method works in Gmail on Google Chrome . If you lost your signature, copy it from a previously sent email! Still Skeptical?
