# Common Security Standards

**Primary Reference:** `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` (Ruleset 4: Security Best Practices).

These are general security standards applicable across the project. Specific modules or contexts may have additional, more detailed security rules.

1.  **API Key Management:**
    *   Refer to `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` Ruleset 4.2.
    *   Secrets and API keys must not be hardcoded. Use configuration management (e.g., `.env` files loaded by `config.py`, environment variables, or a secrets manager).

2.  **Input Validation:**
    *   Refer to `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` Ruleset 4.4.
    *   All external inputs (API request parameters, user-provided data) must be validated (e.g., using Pydantic models).

3.  **Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   Refer to `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` Ruleset 4.1.
    *   Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms as specified for different parts of the application.

4.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Refer to `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` Ruleset 4.3.
    *   Ensure error responses do not leak sensitive information.

5.  **Dependency Security:**
    *   Keep dependencies updated to avoid known vulnerabilities.
    *   (Future consideration: automated dependency scanning - see `packaging_cicd_standards.mdc`)
