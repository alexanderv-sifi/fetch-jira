Most employees have a basic license (40 minute meeting time limit) managed by Simpli.fi ‚Äôs enterprise account. Given that sales team members and executive team members frequently host longer meetings, they have a fully licensed account by default. Logging Into Zoom Due to a security flaw identified with Gmail logins in December 2023, Simpli.fi employees can only log into Zoom via Okta SSO. Here are three ways to log in: The Zoom application tile within¬† the Okta portal ¬†( preferred ) Log into Okta . Click the Zoom application tile in your portal. If for any reason it doesn‚Äôt automatically log you into Zoom, click the SSO login option. This will then verify with Okta and pass you through to your Simpli.fi Zoom account. The Zoom application on your phone ( provided you have Okta Verify or Google Authenticator on your phone for authentication purposes ). You‚Äôll want to verify the phone application through the following steps; and it should keep you logged in for quite some time on your phone. Open your Zoom app and select Sign In. On the next screen, select Sign in with SSO. Enter our company domain simpli-fi so it looks like this simpli-fi.zoom.us Once Okta opens, enter your Okta username (full email).

Upgrading Your Account [NOTE] If you need to record your meeting to the Zoom Cloud, a license is required. If needed, request a Zoom license in #digital-workplace. Due to company policy, we do not permit local recording; and basic accounts do not have the ability to record to the cloud. Employees who frequently need meetings longer than 40 minutes, or who need to record to the Zoom Cloud, can ask for an upgrade: HQ Zoom Meetings If you utilize on-site conference rooms, you may recall that some of them (like Alligator or the Board Room) had built-in systems wherein you would need to log into a computer to be able to host remote/hybrid meetings. This should no longer be the case and therefore should not need Okta login. To ensure the ability to host a Zoom meeting: Ensure the room is included on your calendar invitation (that also includes your Zoom meeting details) When you‚Äôre ready to start your meeting in the room, tap the button on the tablet to initiate hosting the meeting The meeting‚Äôs equipment becomes the host of the Zoom meeting, allowing you Zoom controls.
