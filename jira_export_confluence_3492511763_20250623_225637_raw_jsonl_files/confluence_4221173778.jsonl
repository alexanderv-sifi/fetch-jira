This method provides significantly enhanced security compared to the less secure AdobeID, which relies on traditional username/password authentication. While Adobe fully supports Okta authentication, the actual login process starts on the Adobe side. For your convenience, an Adobe application tile is available on your Okta dashboard, designed to take you directly to the login page. :steps: Steps to Log In to Adobe Stock: Access Okta Dashboard : First, log into your Okta dashboard by navigating to login.simpli.fi .
