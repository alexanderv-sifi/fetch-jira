Please first confirm that you have signed in according to these instructions . If you have an issue where you cannot even get to your Okta portal tile for UKG because you’ve been locked out of Okta, please notify in #digital-workplace Slack channel. Table of Contents [TOC] 3 6 false list false Context The UKG HRIS platform went live on January 2, 2024. All employees are able to at least three ways: Going to their Okta portal (simpli.okta.com) and selected the UKG tile ( preferred) Opening the (CMD + SHIFT + O) and typing UKG before pressing Enter ( also preferred) Going to simplifi.ukg.net directly and clicking the Sign in with your company (SSO) button UKG HRIS login is managed both by the SSO Settings in UKG and the addition of the user to the UKG SSO application in Okta Administration. A provisioning rule was set in UKG to automatically add active UKG users to the SSO functionality in UKG. Employees who are suspended, terminated, or on leave receive an override automatically to login via direct method (username and password) whenever they have the status change. Instructions for HR (Password Reset) Menu > System Configuration > Security > User Administration From the User Administration page, locate the user(s) you wish to reset the user's password to the default password. Check the box next to the selected user. From the available Actions, select Reset Password . Verify the password was reset by noting that the Last Logon field is now blank. This indicates that no previous logins have occurred since the password was reset. Select the Full Name link of the selected user. The User Summary page appears. Select the View Password link from the Default Password field to view the user's default password. Instructions for HR (Reactivating a User) If a user is marked Inactive in the Account Status column in the table on the User Administration , it is likely that they were deactivated for one of the following reasons: They tried to user the Direct Login option but are not whitelisted to do so (e.g., they should have been using Okta to log into UKG). They have a Direct Login override but never changed their default password to be something more robust. In the first case, the employee can be set to active and log into UKG with Okta. In the second case, it is more complex. UKG has a backend script that inactivates users if they did not change their password three months after being loaded into the UKG system. This script will apply to anyone who has a Direct Login override who did not update their default password after the official Go-Live. Unfortunately, this back-end script starts its clock at the loading of employee data, not at the official Go-Live end users. In this case, an administrator will need to select the Reset Password button. [INFO] Currently, the following group memberships have the ability to login directly (not via Okta SSO): Terminated employees Suspended employees On leave employees People Operations employees Digital Workplace employees For more details on this password policy and its impact, please visit UKG’s documentation on the UKG Pro Release.\n\nPage Labels: dws-user, virtual_agent", "url": "https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/4029055001/UKG+Password+Issues", "metadata": {"source": "confluence", "space": "DW", "space_name": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "page_id": "4029055001", "version": 7, "last_modified": "2024-02-21T14:49:23.727Z", "author": "Ashley Graham", "ancestors": [{"id": "3473048177", "title": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3492511763", "title": "Simplifi Employee Technical Guides", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3992813632", "title": "UKG HRIS", "type": "page"}], "child_count": 0}}
