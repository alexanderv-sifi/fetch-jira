{"id": "confluence_4813717527", "title": "UltraDNS (Vercara)", "content": "Engineering team members access Vercara’s UltraDNS to adjust DNS entries for the domains we manage, or to troubleshoot possible DNS issues during on-call. As of December 2024, engineering team members can request access to the UltraDNS platform through an Okta Access Request. Unfortunately, because we cannot force single-sign on for all users, we are not able to fully automate our provisioning yet. So there are some steps for you (and the digital workplace team to take) in requesting access. Instructions Use the standard methods for requesting access: Visit the Okta Access Request portal for the UltraDNS request , or… Use /access ultradns in a Slack message box to have it added to your account. Once you see the UltraDNS SSO tile in your dashboard, it will initiate an automated task for the Digital Workplace team to add you to the UltraDNS account. Once you see an email in your inbox from UltraDNS/Vercara, you can head directly to the UltraDNS tile in Okta and use it. [NOTE] You do not need to setup an UltraDNS account when you see the email invitation. Simply go to the Okta tile as it will pass your username (your work email) to the application. If you do not have the access you need, please reach out to the Digital Workplace team. The default access is the Technical group.\n\nPage Labels: virtual_agent", "url": "https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/4813717527/UltraDNS+Vercara", "metadata": {"source": "confluence", "space": "DW", "space_name": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "page_id": "4813717527", "version": 1, "last_modified": "2024-12-10T19:08:30.684Z", "author": "Ashley Graham", "ancestors": [{"id": "3473048177", "title": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3492511763", "title": "Simplifi Employee Technical Guides", "type": "page"}], "child_count": 0}}
