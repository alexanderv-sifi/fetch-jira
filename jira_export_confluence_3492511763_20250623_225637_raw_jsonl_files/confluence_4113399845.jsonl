With Chrome, you can achieve this for the Okta Portal by following these stepsâ€¦ Instructions In your Chrome browser, navigate to login.simpli.fi (your Okta Portal). Hit the Dot-Menu on the top right of the browser settings. Navigate to Save and Share > Create Shortcut A pop-up will open, giving you the option to name your application. In the prompt for the name, you can name it whatever youâ€™d like (even if you choose a four letter word thatâ€™s not Okta. ðŸ˜‰). Be sure to remember what you called it as youâ€™ll want to find it later in your desktopâ€™s Chrome Apps folder. Select the option to Open as a Window. Hit Create. The Okta portal will now show in your desktopâ€™s Chrome Apps. From there, you can open it, and even add it to your Macbook dock, or have it auto-open upon login to your computer. [Image] This will work for any website (including the Simpli.fi UI!), allowing the website to be launched from your Chrome Apps folder, searched on your computer, or accessed from the docking station. And best of all, you can pull it out of the myriad tabs you might have open for the day.\n\nPage Labels: dws-user, virtual_agent", "url": "https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/4113399845/Make+Okta+a+Desktop+Application", "metadata": {"source": "confluence", "space": "DW", "space_name": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "page_id": "4113399845", "version": 1, "last_modified": "2024-02-23T17:18:52.468Z", "author": "Ashley Graham", "ancestors": [{"id": "3473048177", "title": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3492511763", "title": "Simplifi Employee Technical Guides", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3621290012", "title": "Okta", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3620143105", "title": "Initial Setup", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3662577671", "title": "How To Use Okta", "type": "page"}], "child_count": 0}}
