Historically, for the Client Success team and for the Sales team, reviewed these requests. So that the requests are not dependent on the availability of these two employees, the Digital Workplace team can assist with requests for access. Instructions If you need access to LiveRamp Connect, you can request it via: The Okta Access Requests Portal’s LiveRamp Connect Request Type Using the /access liveramp command in a Slack message box Reaching out in #digital-workplace with your request. Once you submit your request, your email address will be immediately added to the Okta LiveRamp Connect application group. This will allow you to see the LiveRamp Connect tile. [Image] Even if you see the tile, there is an additional action required by the Digital Workplace team to add you in LiveRamp. The Okta Support Slack app or the Digital Workplace employee connecting with you will notify when complete. To log into it in the future, you can either select the Okta LiveRamp tile, use the Okta Chrome extension, or go to LiveRamp’s site and let Okta pass your credentials for you.
