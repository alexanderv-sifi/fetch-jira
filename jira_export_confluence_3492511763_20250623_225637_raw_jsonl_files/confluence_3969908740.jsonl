{"id": "confluence_3969908740", "title": "Okta Login Email Changes", "content": "[TOC] If you are viewing this page because your gotoadvantage.com account is changing to a simpli.fi email domain, please see the bottom of this page for additional context. https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/3969908740/Okta+Login+Email+Changes#Current-Status-of-User-Accounts-Transitioned-from-gotoadvantage-Domain Applications Requiring Manual Steps from You There are a few apps that Okta doesn't manage that you would have to update on your end (if you used your gotoadvantage.com account originally for these). Some examples of apps that are not connected with Okta: Rippling (most people use their personal email to log into this anyway) HSA if applicable (related to Rippling; it is recommended to use your personal email) Fidelity (most people use their personal email for this as well) AppleID (if applicable; not everyone has a Macbook or signed up for Apple App Store) IcePanel (if applicable) Bitwarden (if applicable; it is preferred for you to change your email in the settings so as not to lose any personal use of Bitwarden for passwords.) Browserstack (if applicable, will assist in changing logins for developers) Any app integrations you use for Atlassian ( Jira / Confluence ) need to be re-authorized with the Simpli.fi account. You will be prompted to do so when clicking into a relevant app (e.g., Google Sheets, Scribehow) Outlook (if you use Outlook, please update your Gmail settings accordingly to send from both email accounts). Once logged into Gmail website in your browser, go to the settings gear ⚙️ Select See All Settings in the right-side panel that opens Click the Accounts and Import section Under the Send mail as sub-section, click Add another email address and enter your gotoadvantage email as an additional account. Click Save to keep this change. Windstream (if you have this tile in Okta, it is a “Bookmark Tile” that we cannot manage, but you can edit in the Windstream application and edit your tile in Okta to match once done). The #facilities-enduser-support team can assist with Windstream if needed. Applications Requiring Manual Steps from Digital Workplace Team Signite for new account email signature Confirmation of Zendesk functionality (ensure no customer/end-user account duplication) Confirmation of Salesforce functionality (ensure no conflict with user having @simpli.fi account in another Sandbox instance). Confirmation of Zoom functionality (ensure no pre-existing @simpli.fi email account) DataDog (confirm manual override of user given recent provisioning through Okta) Perimeter81 (verification that a duplicate account not created) Atlassian Group (addition to the Atlassian group for all-advantage in Okta) Bitwarden (manually override user if they are unable to do so themselves) Bullseye (Digital Workplace contact for user email change) Current Status of User Accounts Transitioned from gotoadvantage Domain In the fourth quarter of 2023, a decision was made to update all gotoadvantage accounts to simpli.fi email domains. This was in part for seamless login experience for the user (fewer credential combinations to maintain, or discrepancies between Okta logins). It was also prioritized due to the pending change from Rippling HRIS to UKG HRIS, effective January 1, 2024.
