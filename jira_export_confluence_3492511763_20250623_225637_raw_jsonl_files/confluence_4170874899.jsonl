Help yourself and your team by using Slack’s thread functionality! [TOC] 1 6 false list pipe false 👍 Best Practices Wondering when to message directly in-channel vs. starting a thread? Consider this advice from Slack’s documentation … Ask yourself: How busy is this channel currently? Is there an active discussion taking place? How many people are in the channel, and is my response relevant to everyone or just a few people? Is my response to the message highly detailed? In other words, the best practice is to use a thread if: The channel is busy The channel has a lot of team members Your response to a topic is highly detailed Your message merits a deep discussion around a specific topic Your message is pertinent only to select people If you happen to respond in a thread and don’t want to get pinged when others response, you can always turn off the notifications for replies to a thread . Conversely, if you want more visibility on the thread, consider pulling it out into its own separate window through the window icon in the upper right-hand corner of the thread 👎 Not-Great Practices Try not to add your response to as an in-channel message if you’re meaning to contribute to one specific discussion in a channel. Try not to use threads to make additional requests long after the initial request was first made. For example, sometimes a person will have an open conversation about an issue in the #digital-workplace channel. The issue is resolved, but months later they or someone else comes back to the thread to talk about it. If the task is important to complete, consider submitting a request to the team member in the way they/their team likes to receive work ( Simpli.fi Service Desk portal? Direct message in Slack? Software Jira task?). 💡 Pro Tip! If you’re tempted to take up a lot of Slack channel real estate ( guilty as charged… ) with a long message or complex topic, consider initiating a thread on your own message: {Relevant emoji} + {message subject} + details in thread… Enter a response to yourself, or additional points you’d like to be considered in the tread below your header message.
