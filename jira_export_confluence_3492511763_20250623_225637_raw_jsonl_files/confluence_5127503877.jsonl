Here's a breakdown of the steps: Physical Inspection: Check the Power Outlet: Ensure the outlet is working by plugging in another device. Try a different outlet to rule out a faulty power source. Inspect the Power Adapter and Cable: Look for any signs of damage: frayed cables, bent pins, or discoloration. Ensure the cable is securely connected to both the adapter and the MacBook. If your adapter has a detachable AC wall plug, try reseating it, or try a different wall plug. Check the MacBook's Charging Port: Inspect the port for debris, dust, or lint. Carefully clean the port with a soft, dry, lint-free cloth. Verify the Adapter: make sure you are using the correct power adapter for your macbook. Using a lower wattage adapter may provide power to the macbook, but not enough to charge the battery. Software and System Checks: Restart Your MacBook: A simple restart can often resolve minor software glitches that may be interfering with charging. Check Battery Health: In macOS, go to System Settings > Battery > Battery Health. Check the battery's condition. If it says \"Service Recommended,\" the battery may need to be replaced. Check for Software Updates: Ensure your macOS is up to date, as updates can include fixes for charging issues. Go to System Settings > General > Software Update. Further Troubleshooting: Try a Different Charging Cable and Adapter: If possible, test with a known working cable and adapter to isolate the problem. Apple Diagnostics: Run Apple Diagnostics to check for hardware issues. Apple support provides information on how to run these diagnostics. When to Seek Help: If not fixed, contact the Digital Workplace team in Slack #digital-workplace. *AI generated.\n\nPage Labels: virtual_agent", "url": "https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/5127503877/Charging+problems", "metadata": {"source": "confluence", "space": "DW", "space_name": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "page_id": "5127503877", "version": 1, "last_modified": "2025-03-26T15:27:20.077Z", "author": "Rodney Estrada", "ancestors": [{"id": "3473048177", "title": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3492511763", "title": "Simplifi Employee Technical Guides", "type": "page"}], "child_count": 0}}
