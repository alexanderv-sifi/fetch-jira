{"id": "confluence_4704829444", "title": "UKG PTO Slack Integration", "content": "UKG Flow Slack application allows you to punch, submit requests, and view schedules in Slack without the need to switch applications. At Simpli.fi , most (if not all) employees are salaried employees. So we do not use the time punch or work scheduling functionality of the UKG Flow app. However, some might be interested in the Time Off feature set. Instructions [PANEL] For a screen recorded video of these instructions, please see the following: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z1ggFvyGaiJX6yQyejjq9-8sO8sgm-Fh/view?usp=drive_link Add the UKG Flow app to Slack. Select Apps in the left-hand sidebar menu. Select Manage > Browse Apps . From within the Simpli.fi workspace, search for UKG Flow. Click it to add. Within the UKG Flow Slack app, you will be asked to login. Click the Login button. If you are not seeing this button, you can always check that you are logged in by typing /ukg login from within the application message box. A browser tab will open, asking you to log into UKG. Proceed to do so with the standard login option (Okta) via SSO. Once you log in successfully, you will see a success message in the browser and be redirected back to Slack. You can then use the Time Off button to either Request Time Off or see your existing PTO requests via the Time Off Status button.\n\nPage Labels: virtual_agent", "url": "https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/4704829444/UKG+PTO+Slack+Integration", "metadata": {"source": "confluence", "space": "DW", "space_name": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "page_id": "4704829444", "version": 1, "last_modified": "2024-10-30T21:40:16.482Z", "author": "Ashley Graham", "ancestors": [{"id": "3473048177", "title": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3492511763", "title": "Simplifi Employee Technical Guides", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3992813632", "title": "UKG HRIS", "type": "page"}], "child_count": 0}}
