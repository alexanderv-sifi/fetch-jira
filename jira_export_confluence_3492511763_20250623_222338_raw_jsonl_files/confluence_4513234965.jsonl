We know that the adjustment from AdobeSign to DocuSign was a big change. To make life easier, please view the recording for: Insertion Order Template Tips Shared Access functionality What’s coming in Salesforce<>DocuSign https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xugKFOfWO_TKPMcyIm72VL3W-bcDZ8hq/view?usp=drive_link \n Sharing Document Envelopes If you ever need to be out of office for a time, or want another team member to consistently be able to take actions on a DocuSign envelope you manage, you can adjust your Shared Access settings. [PANEL] See DocuSign’s documentation and videos on this topic. \n Signing Documents DocuSign allows users to sign their own documents--not simply send documents to other for signature. This feature allows you to quickly upload and sign from the Home or the Agreements page. [PANEL] See DocuSign’s documentation and videos on this topic. \n Adding Multiple Documents to an Envelope Add multiple documents at a time from your local laptop or from your Google Drive account. DocuSign allows users to send multiple file types for signature by others. [PANEL] See DocuSign’s documentation and videos on this topic \n Sending Documents for Signature Customize with messages, reminders, expiration dates, recipient privileges, and field data. [PANEL] See DocuSign’s documentation and videos on this topic. \n Creating A Template Skip repeatable tasks by pre-setting standard and custom fields. [PANEL] See DocuSign’s documentation and videos on this topic.[Image]\n Sharing Templates With Others Share templates you’ve created with others in a group or as individuals.

Otherwise your entered data will disappear. Also, please do not apply a template to your document retroactively if you are trying to retain the values you’ve entered outside of DocuSign. :light_bulb_on: If you find you commonly enter data into an editable Insertion Order PDF, consider using the Media Insertion Order (STANDARD) template, as this will allow you to enter data directly into fields within DocuSign.
