For your convenience, an Adobe application tile is available on your Okta dashboard, designed to take you directly to the login page. :steps: Steps to Log In to Adobe Firefly: Follow these steps to securely log in to Adobe Firefly using your Simplifi credentials: Access Okta Dashboard : First, log into your Okta dashboard by navigating to login.simpli.fi .
