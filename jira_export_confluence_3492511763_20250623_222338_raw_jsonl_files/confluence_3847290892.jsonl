{"id": "confluence_3847290892", "title": "Looker", "content": "Introduction We use Looker to visualize data. At this time, Looker is also integrated with the Simpli.fi App via the Report Center. Simpli.fi is utilizes a hosted Looker solution (cloud-based). The instructions below are for Simpli.fi Looker. [INFO] Currently, the BidTellect Simpli.fi team hosts their own Looker solution on premises; it is accessible via VPN. If you are part of the legacy Bidtellect team, you would access Bidtellect Looker via Cisco VPN . If you are not, you would access Bidtellect Looker via Perimeter 81 VPN. Access Login to your Okta portal Click the Looker (Simpli.fi) tile. [Image] Authorize your account via Google when prompted. Troubleshooting If you’re encountering issues logging into Looker, you may be using the same browser window for the and entering Looker. Technically, there are two Looker users for each person (one for the App Report Center and the Looker site proper). If you’re using the same browser, when you go from the App to Looker proper, it attempts to use your App user (which won’t have access to Looker). If you didn’t follow the steps above to log in from your Okta portal, try going directly to looker.simpli.fi/login and it should prompt you to sign in via Google. This will utilize single sign-on to permit you access. [PANEL] If you ever happen to need both for some reason, opening them in private (incognito) browser sessions will let you view both at the same time. If you have any issues, please reach out in the #digital-workplace Slack channel for assistance .
