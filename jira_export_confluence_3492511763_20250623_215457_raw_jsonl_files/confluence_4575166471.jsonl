Connecting Your Group Calendar to Slack Slack used to have a Google Calendar for Teams Slack application that has since been deprecated. However, they have been working to add this functionality to their Google Calendar application. They state that theoretically, someone could connect a team calendar to a Slack channel by following their process for adding personal calendars to a Slack Channel. Please see Slack documentation for the most up-to-date status of this feature. Individual Calendar Events Transfer Through Google Workspace Administration and GAM command line, the Digital Workplace team has the ability to transfer calendar event ownership at a per-event or per-user level. [INFO] Whenever an employee transitions from Simpli.fi , the Digital Workplace team automatically transfers ownership of their calendar events to their manager. And should another user (not their manager) need to own a former employee’s calendar (or even just one of their events), we have the ability to honor that request in the #digital-workplace Slack Channel.", "url": "https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/4575166471/Create+a+Google+Calendar+for+a+Group", "metadata": {"source": "confluence", "space": "DW", "space_name": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "page_id": "4575166471", "version": 3, "last_modified": "2024-09-12T17:58:39.660Z", "author": "Ashley Graham", "ancestors": [{"id": "3473048177", "title": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3492511763", "title": "Simplifi Employee Technical Guides", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3621814280", "title": "Google", "type": "page"}], "child_count": 0, "permissions": {"read_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "update_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "is_restricted": false}, "is_restricted": false}}
