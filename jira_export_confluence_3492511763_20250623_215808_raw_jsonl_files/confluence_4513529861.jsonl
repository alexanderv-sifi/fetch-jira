In DocuSign, you do not have to recreate them from scratch but can actually upload templates (one at a time or in a bulk .zip file). [PANEL] See DocuSignâ€™s documentation and videos on this topic. Using PowerForms [PANEL] See DocuSignâ€™s documentation and videos on this topic. Requesting Agreement Actions If thereâ€™s something youâ€™d like to be standardized (exporting your files to your Google Drive folder, or export file data to a Google sheet), you can pursue a change to agreement actions. [PANEL] See DocuSignâ€™s documentation and videos on this topic. Demoing DocuSign Maestro While we do not currently have DocuSign Maestro, we are able to get some demo developer accounts for our use cases. We will be exploring this to further reduce unnecessary manual steps in workflows. [PANEL] See DocuSignâ€™s documentation and videos on this topic. [PANEL] We are also looking into the feasibility of DocuSign CPQ+ or DocuSign Contract Lifecycle Management functionality for DSP teams. In the meantime, we are exploring quicker wins for Salesforce Integrations and will update as they are built.", "url": "https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/4513529861/DocuSign+Advanced+Features", "metadata": {"source": "confluence", "space": "DW", "space_name": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "page_id": "4513529861", "version": 5, "last_modified": "2024-08-22T19:49:41.314Z", "author": "Ashley Graham", "ancestors": [{"id": "3473048177", "title": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3492511763", "title": "Simplifi Employee Technical Guides", "type": "page"}, {"id": "4513169437", "title": "DocuSign E-Signature", "type": "page"}], "child_count": 0, "permissions": {"read_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "update_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "is_restricted": false}, "is_restricted": false}}
