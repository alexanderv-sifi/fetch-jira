There may be some instances where you will need to Re-enroll if your MFA was reset for a device. Click the Re-enroll link and register your machine. [NOTE] If you use a password manager in addition to Okta (like Dashlane), please be aware that Okta puts security keys and biometric authentication in the same bucket, so to speak. So when you have a security key provided by Dashlane, it may not know to default to your Macbook biometric authenticator. Simply click Verify with something else after you first enter your email address. Click the option for Security Key or Biometric Authenticator and select the option that is not the security associated with your password manager.", "url": "https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/4024041523/Giving+Okta+the+Finger", "metadata": {"source": "confluence", "space": "DW", "space_name": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "page_id": "4024041523", "version": 8, "last_modified": "2024-09-17T17:30:18.413Z", "author": "Bill Price", "ancestors": [{"id": "3473048177", "title": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3492511763", "title": "Simplifi Employee Technical Guides", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3621290012", "title": "Okta", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3620143105", "title": "Initial Setup", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3620012052", "title": "Authentication Methods", "type": "page"}], "child_count": 0, "permissions": {"read_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "update_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "is_restricted": false}, "is_restricted": false}}
