This document outlines the process and steps required for the safe and compliant use of AI for individual employee use. Adhering to these guidelines helps prevent misuse of company proprietary information and security incidents, ensuring data protection and compliance with legal limits and privacy policies. Support or Feedback For questions, comments, or feedback regarding this AI policy or AI usage, please contact Ryan Falsetti, Privacy Compliance Manager, via Slack or email the Privacy Team at privacy@simpli.fi . The Privacy Team is available to assist with any inquiries related to AI compliance, data use, and security. Mandatory AI Tool Approval Checklist: Before Using New AI Systems Before deploying any new AI system, AI tool, or AI software, employees must complete the following checklist to ensure safe and approved AI usage. This process helps troubleshoot potential compliance issues and data risks. 1. Legal Compliance and Approved Tools Approved AI Tools: Check if the AI tool is already approved for Simplifi use. A list of existing software tools with Embedded AI Tools that are approved at Simplifi can be found [here - link to be inserted]. Unlisted Tools: If an AI tool is not listed on the approved software list, its use is not prohibited automatically. However, you must notify the Compliance Team (via the Privacy Team at privacy@simpli.fi ) about the tool being used for their records. The Compliance Team will then add it to the approved list after review. Legal Expertise & Contract Review: Does the AI tool require legal expertise or involve the review of a contract? If yes, you must follow the AI Use for Enterprise Process. Non-Public Simplifi Information: Will the AI tool process or use Non-Public Simplifi information? If yes, you must follow the AI Use for Enterprise Process. 2. Data Use and Confidentiality Confidential or Sensitive Information: Will the AI process or use any confidential information or sensitive information? Discrimination Risk: Could the AI be used in a way that discriminates based on protected characteristics (e.g., gender, race, sexual orientation, political affiliation)? This includes potential bias in AI-generated content. Action Required for Confidential/Sensitive Data: If yes to either of the above data use questions, immediately email privacy@simpli.fi . Include all relevant information about the AI program and a list of the specific data elements you intend to use. If no to both questions, you may proceed to the next step. Privacy Assessment: Once the Privacy Team reviews the data use details, they will conduct a privacy assessment to identify and mitigate any areas of risk related to data handling and security. 3. Policy Review and External AI Privacy Product Privacy Policy Review: You are required to review the product’s privacy policy for any AI system you intend to use. Warning: Be highly cautious of privacy policies that allow all information entered into their system to be used to train their AI model. This poses a significant data privacy risk. Data Collection & Usage Awareness: Are you fully aware of what data the AI service collects and how that data is used by the third-party provider? Concerns & Assistance: If you have any questions or concerns about an AI product's privacy policy, send the policy to the Privacy Team at privacy@simpli.fi for assistance and review. Employee Liability: Remember, your actions play a direct role in the security of the organization. Depending on the scenario, employees could be held liable for misuse of company proprietary information or security incidents resulting from unapproved or non-compliant AI usage. 4. Review Plan for AI Output Accuracy and Bias Check: Is there a plan or process for reviewing AI-generated content (e.g., AI writing, AI data, summaries, code generation) for accuracy and bias? Understandability & Verification: Is the AI output something you fully understand and can verify for accuracy? This is critical for preventing incorrect information or misleading data.", "url": "https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/5016649760/AI+Usage+Policy+and+Guidelines+Individual+Employee+Use", "metadata": {"source": "confluence", "space": "DW", "space_name": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "page_id": "5016649760", "version": 3, "last_modified": "2025-06-12T15:24:42.799Z", "author": "Bill Price", "ancestors": [{"id": "3473048177", "title": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3492511763", "title": "Simplifi Employee Technical Guides", "type": "page"}, {"id": "4428169266", "title": "AI Guides: Approved AI Tools", "type": "page"}], "permissions": {"read_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "update_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "is_restricted": false}, "is_restricted": false}}
{"id": "confluence_5016780813", "title": "Enterprise AI: Implementation and Non-Public Information Usage Policy", "content": "FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE Simplifi recognizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a strategic component for developing and improving products, processes, and procedures. This document outlines the essential steps required to implement AI at the Enterprise level or to use AI tools that handle non-public Simplifi information. Adhering to this policy ensures compliance, data security, and proper risk management for all enterprise AI initiatives. Support or Feedback For questions, comments, or feedback concerning this Enterprise AI policy or the AI approval process, please contact Ryan Falsetti, Privacy Compliance Manager, via Slack or email the Compliance Team directly at privacy@simpli.fi . The Compliance Team is available to assist with your inquiries and provide guidance on AI implementation and compliance requirements. Enterprise AI Approval Process This multi-step approval process is mandatory for all enterprise AI projects and AI tools using non-public Simplifi data. Following these steps will streamline AI adoption while ensuring security and regulatory compliance. Step One: Initial Discussion and Request Submission Manager Discussion: Begin by discussing the AI tool and its specific use case with your manager or team lead. Clarify the purpose and benefits of the AI integration. Paid AI Tools: If the AI tool is paid software, obtain manager approval. Your manager must then submit the request to the Procurement team by creating a Jira ticket. This initiates the procurement process for the new AI solution. Free AI Tools using Non-Public Information: If the AI tool is free but will be processing or using non-public Simplifi information (e.g., confidential data, proprietary data, sensitive company information), you must create a Jira ticket. For the \"Project\" field in Jira, select \"Compliance.\" This action automatically kicks off a compliance review for the AI tool and its intended data use. Step Two: Compliance Review and Assessment Forms Compliance Team Contact: After creating the Jira ticket (for either procurement or compliance), the Compliance Team will contact you. Privacy & AI Pre-Assessment Forms: If deemed necessary, you will receive a copy of the Privacy Pre-Assessment form and the included AI Pre-Assessment Form. Completing these forms is crucial for the Compliance Team to understand what data is being used by the AI tool and how it will be processed, handled, and stored. Data Privacy/Security Assessment Determination: The Compliance Team will review the completed assessment forms. Based on this review, they will determine whether a full Data Privacy/Security Assessment needs to be conducted, especially if the AI use case involves high-risk processing or falls under regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Step Three: Risk Assessment and Documentation High-Risk Processing Assessment: If a Data Privacy/Security Assessment needs to be conducted due to high-risk processing (e.g., handling Personal Identifiable Information (PII), sensitive data categories, large-scale data processing), the Compliance Team will conduct this additional assessment with you. This collaborative process ensures all risks are identified and mitigated. No Assessment Required (Documented Justification): If an assessment does not need to be done due to the low nature of the risk, the Compliance Team will produce clear documentation stating that a risk assessment is not required and will explain the rationale. This decision will be documented in Vanta for audit and record-keeping purposes. Step Four: Implementation and Ongoing Management Ongoing Compliance Communication: As you implement the AI tool, it is critical to keep the Compliance Team apprised of any new developments, changes in scope, or unexpected changes related to the AI system or its data usage. Compliance Team Involvement for High-Risk Projects: If PII (Personal Identifiable Information) is being used by the AI tool, or if the AI tool could present a security risk if not implemented properly, you must invite the relevant Compliance Team members to planning and onboarding calls. Their assistance during these critical phases is vital to ensure proper security controls and data governance are in place from the outset, preventing project delays or compliance issues down the line. This proactive engagement is key to successful and secure AI deployment.", "url": "https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/5016780813/Enterprise+AI+Implementation+and+Non-Public+Information+Usage+Policy", "metadata": {"source": "confluence", "space": "DW", "space_name": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "page_id": "5016780813", "version": 3, "last_modified": "2025-06-12T18:08:24.141Z", "author": "Bill Price", "ancestors": [{"id": "3473048177", "title": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3492511763", "title": "Simplifi Employee Technical Guides", "type": "page"}, {"id": "4428169266", "title": "AI Guides: Approved AI Tools", "type": "page"}], "permissions": {"read_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "update_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "is_restricted": false}, "is_restricted": false}}

{"id": "confluence_4081483819", "title": "AWS Key Guide: AWS Key Rotation Guidelines and Best Practices", "content": "The Digital Workplace team's audit of user key rotation in Q3-Q4 2023 highlighted challenges not fully addressed by previous AWS documentation. This led to a re-evaluation of how Simplifi manages AWS access for external clients and internal users , particularly concerning AWS IAM Administration . Historical Challenges with User Key Rotation Historically, Simplifi provided AWS access to external clients by adding users to our AWS IAM Administration or, in some instances, by sharing users directly with clients. This approach has presented difficulties, especially with rotating user keys. To maintain compliance with the standards set by one of Simplifi's private equity firms (GTCR), user AWS keys must be rotated every 90 days. This requirement became problematic when managing numerous external client users. Recommended Best Practice: AWS ARN for Bucket Policies When granting external clients access to Simplifi S3 buckets, the recommended and most secure approach is to request the client's AWS ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) for the roles they maintain. These ARNs can then be directly added to the S3 bucket policy. This method offers significant advantages over Simplifi maintaining individual users for clients: It eliminates the need for Simplifi to manage and rotate client user keys every 90 days, ensuring ongoing compliance with key rotation standards. It shifts the responsibility of user management and key rotation back to the client, simplifying Simplifi's IAM administration. Future Enhancements and Current Support The Infrastructure Value Stream Team is currently exploring long-term solutions, such as implementing the AWS KWS solution to auto-rotate AWS user keys for both clients and internal users. In the interim, your assistance is crucial in encouraging clients to configure their AWS access at the bucket policy level using ARNs. This collaborative effort helps maintain our security posture and compliance.

Updating Ticket Status : Start Work : When you're ready to begin working on a ticket, change its status from \"Open\" to \"Work in Progress.\" You can do this directly on the ticket in Jira, or by using the relevant emoji in the #digital-workplace Slack channel if the request originated there. → Will assign the ticket to you. → Will automatically close out the ticket -> Will assign to Work in Progress or Pending Pause SLA (Pending) : If you need to pause the SLA (Service Level Agreement) clock because you're waiting for information or action from the requester, a vendor, or another party, change the ticket status from \"Work in Progress\" to \"Pending.\" You can do this on the ticket itself, or via the relevant emoji in the #digital-workplace Slack channel . Close Ticket : Once you've successfully addressed and resolved the issue, change the ticket status from \"Pending\" or \"Work in Progress\" to \"Closed.\" This can be done directly on the ticket in Jira, or via the relevant emoji in the #digital-workplace Slack channel . Commenting on Issues : You can add comments to an issue via Slack (if it originated in the #digital-workplace channel) or directly through the Jira interface. Add internal note: Use this option if your comment is only for other service desk agents. This is ideal for resolution notes, troubleshooting steps, or questions for colleagues. Reply to customer: Choose this option if your comment is intended to be visible to the requester. This will also send them an email notification, depending on their Jira notification settings. Log into Jira to see the Service Desk Portal issues you have assigned to yourself in the queue (My Open Issues). Alternatively, you can click the link in an email from Jira when notified of the issue assignment. To change an assignee (whether assigning to yourself or someone else), select the Assignee field on the right-hand side of the issue. You have the option to assign it to yourself or another person with agent access to the DWS service desk. When you are ready to start work on the ticket, move it from Open to Work in Progress . You can do this on the ticket itself, or via the emoji in #digital-workplace if the request originated there. If you need to pause the SLA clock on a ticket because you are waiting on something from the requester, a vendor, or other party, move the ticket from Work in Progress to Pending . You can do this on the ticket itself, or via the emoji in #digital-workplace if the request originated there. You can comment on the issue via Slack (if it was submitted in #digital-workplace channel at its inception), or via the Jira interface. If you need to comment on the issue in Jira, there are two options: Add internal note : Will only show the comment to fellow service desk agents. This is often used to communicate issue resolution notes or questions for other agents. Reply to customer : Will show the comment as visible to the issue’s requestor, and will also send them an email (depending on whether they’ve turned off Jira notifications to email). When you have addressed the issue in the ticket, move it from its Pending or Work in Progress status to a Closed status. You can do this on the ticket itself, or via the emoji in #digital-workplace if the request originated there. Reminder Messages Once a week, an Okta workflow will message you in Slack if you have any outstanding Digital Workplace service desk tickets that are not closed.

{"id": "confluence_3758293159", "title": "Datadog Guide: Applications Keys & Service Accounts", "content": "Service accounts are non-interactive accounts designed to manage application keys and other resources shared among teams. For instance, consider a scenario where an employee creates a monitoring dashboard using their personal application key. If that employee departs from the company, their Datadog account is deactivated, rendering their application key inactive. Consequently, the monitoring dashboard will cease to function until someone updates it with a valid application key. To prevent this issue, utilizing a service account application key instead of a personal application key for automated requests to the Datadog API is highly recommended. Note: Creating Service Accounts requires admin access. To view / access service accounts in the UI: Navigate to Organization Settings from your account menu. Under Accounts , select Service Accounts . Create service account To create a service account, perform the following steps: Click New Service Account . A dialog box appears. Enter a name and email address for your service account. Note: This can be a Google Group email address. Use the Assign Roles dropdown menu to choose one or more roles for your service account. Custom roles can be created to ensure that the service account has only the access it needs. Find out how to create custom roles here. To save, click Create Service Account . Unlike the email addresses for Datadog users, service account email addresses do not need to be unique across an organization. Edit service account To modify a service account, click on one in the service accounts list. In the side panel, click Edit next to the service account name. A dialog box appears. Update any fields you would like to change. You can edit the name, email address, status, and roles. Click Save . To disable a service account, follow the procedure above to edit the service account and set the status to Disabled . Create or revoke application keys To create or revoke service account application keys, select an account from the service account list. The service account’s side panel appears. To create a new application key, follow the steps below: Click New Key . A dialog box appears. Give the key a descriptive name. Click Create Key . The dialog box refreshes, showing you the key. Copy and paste the key into your desired location. After you close the dialog box, you cannot retrieve the value of the key. To revoke an application key, locate the key in the service account detailed view side panel and hover over it. You will see pencil and trash can icons appear on the right side. Click the trash can icon to revoke the key. After revocation, click Confirm . Note: You can view a service account application key only once, immediately after its creation. Limiting access to the application key helps prevent issues that may arise if another user gains access to it. If you lose or forget a service account key, revoke it and create a new one. Permissions Creating a service account allows you to establish an entity that interacts with Datadog on your behalf. The options available to you on the Service Accounts page are determined by your specific Datadog roles and permissions. To create a service account, you must possess the Service Account Write permission. This permission is included in the Datadog Admin role, meaning that anyone with this role can create service accounts. When setting up a service account, you have the flexibility to assign it any combination of the roles and permissions that you hold. However, if you have the User Access Manage permission, you effectively gain administrator-level access, allowing you to perform any action within Datadog. Accounts with the User Access Manage permission face no limitations regarding the roles and permissions they can assign to service accounts. Notifications Datadog sends a notification to the email address associated with the service account when the following actions occur: Create an application key Revoke an application key Disable the service account", "url": "https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/3758293159/Datadog+Guide+Applications+Keys+Service+Accounts", "metadata": {"source": "confluence", "space": "DW", "space_name": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "page_id": "3758293159", "version": 4, "last_modified": "2025-06-13T18:20:25.603Z", "author": "Bill Price", "ancestors": [{"id": "3473048177", "title": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3492511763", "title": "Simplifi Employee Technical Guides", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3758850051", "title": "Datadog Guide:", "type": "page"}], "permissions": {"read_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "update_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "is_restricted": false}, "is_restricted": false}}

{"id": "confluence_3844472833", "title": "Miro Board Role Groups - What are they and why do they matter?", "content": "This board provides a visual representation of the functional roles throughout our organization. A role refers to a position, job title, or set of tasks assigned to an individual. It helps us understand the organizational structure and responsibilities within our company. By visualizing the hierarchy and relationships between roles, we aim to foster a more efficient and effective work environment. Purpose and Significance The primary purpose of this Miro board is to provide a clear overview of our company's functional roles, enabling better collaboration and understanding across different teams and departments. Our company's functional roles are organized using a bottom-up approach, where the lowest point in the hierarchy comes first. The hierarchy is structured as follows: Roles: a position, job title, or set of tasks assigned to an individual Teams : Cross-functional teams, or sub-teams operating within the departments. Value Streams: Sub departments within Engineering. Departments : Situated under each division, representing specific functional areas within the divisions. Divisions : The highest level of the hierarchy, representing the five main divisions in our company: Administration Marketing Client Services Engineering Sales Roles: a position, job title, or set of tasks assigned to an individual Sub Teams : Org Level 4 Teams/Value Streams: Org Level 3 Sub Departments : Org Level 2 Departments : Org Level 1 - The highest level of the hierarchy, representing the five main departments in our company: Administration Marketing Client Services Engineering Sales Naming Scheme Explanation We use a consistent naming scheme for each group to make identification and understanding easier. The naming scheme follows this format: Role : <role-name>_<team-name>_role Sub Team: <sub-team-name>_<team-name>_subteam Team : <team-name>_<sub-department-name>_team (or <team-name>_<vs-name>_team for value streams) Value Stream : <vs-name>_<sub-department-name>_vs Sub Department : <sub-department-name>_<department-name>_subdept Division : <department-name>_dept Why Use This Group Structure? Rather than assigning individual permissions to each user (which is considered bad practice), we can assign permissions based on the person's 'role'. These roles allow us to easily manage permissions for individuals by assigning a few groups, rather than configuring permissions across hundreds of applications. This streamlined approach enhances security, simplifies access management, and reduces the risk of errors. Moreover, with this group structure, any new hire coming into their position already has all the permissions they will need on day one. This eliminates delays in granting access and ensures employees can start being productive right away. This method also ensures that when an employee leaves the company, their access is removed immediately when the groups are unassigned from their profile.

{"id": "confluence_3620143105", "title": "Initial Setup", "content": "What is Okta? Okta is an identity and access management platform that allows you to use one password for all your applications with an extra layer of security using multi-factor authentication. Okta is the front door to all your applications. Once you’re in, you’ll see a custom dashboard tailored to have all the applications IT has assigned to you. Click on one and you’re automatically logged in. No need to re-enter any credentials. 1. Account Setup You should receive an email from Okta with the subject line “ [ACTION REQUIRED] Hello from the Simpli.fi Digital Workplace Team!” . This email expires after 7 days, so if you need to have it resent to your mailbox please reach out to the #digital-workplace Slack channel or email digitalworkplace@simpli.fi. After you click ‘Activate Okta Account’, it will open your web browser and ask you to set your password . 2. Authenticators at Setup After you set your password and log into your machine, you will be prompted to setup a second authentication method. Only one is required, but it is highly recommended to have multiple. Okta Fastpass (Most Recommended) > System Settings > TouchID) Click ‘ Sign in with Okta FastPass ’ ( you may have to click it twice ) Okta Verify on your machine will open up. Click ‘ Add Account ’ if you do not have Okta Verify on your machine, download and install it Your default web browser will launch and display the Okta login page. Enter your Okta username and click ' Next '. Follow the prompts to sign into your Okta accoun t. After successfully signing in, Okta Verify will open again and prompt you to add your Touch ID with Okta Verify. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete this process. Okta Verify Mobile App (Recommended) A mobile app that Okta sends a push notification to your phone for you to accept or deny. Okta Verify does not collect information or grant us any access to your personal cell phone data. For more information about what this app does and does not do, please see here: or reach out to the #digital-workplace team. How do I setup Okta Verify? Download the Okta Verify app from your app store. When prompted to setup a verification method, select ‘Okta Verify’ Open the Okta Verify app on your phone Click the ‘+' sign in the upper right hand corner, select ‘Organization’, then 'Yes, Ready to Scan’ Scan the QR code on your computer screen Click ‘Enable’ Done! Biometric Login (Required for Mac) If you are using a Mac, you most likely have a fingerprint reader located at the top right. Using your fingerprint allows you to sign into your applications extremely quickly with just the tap of your finger. However, if you choose this method, it is highly recommended to setup a second authentication method, such as Okta Verify to prevent account lock outs in the event you change computers. How do I setup biometric login? When prompted to setup an authentication method, select ‘Security Key or Biometric Authenticator’ When prompted to setup a security key, click ‘Continue’ Tap your finger on the fingerprint reader Done! Google Authenticator (Not Recommended) This option you may have already used with previous applications at simpli.fi . It may be a little more cumbersome to use than the above two methods, but it is just as safe and secure. Google authenticator generates a six-digit code you will type into Okta to sign in. How do I setup Google Authenticator? Download the Google Authenticator app from the app store. When prompted to choose your authentication method, select ‘Google Authenticator’ Open the Google Authenticator app on your phone Within the app, press the rainbow plus sign button in the bottom right hand corner, then select ‘Scan QR code’ Scan the QR code with your phone Click ‘Next’ on your computer Enter the code listed under ‘ login.simpli.fi ’ on your Google authenticator app Done! Finishing Up Once you complete the authenticator setup, you should be led to your end user dashboard or prompted to sign in. Since you are already signed into Okta, you will not need to sign in again to your other apps and can click on them from the dashboard. After you’ve setup these main authenticators, we advise that you also set up We highly recommend installing the Okta browser plug in, which will enable you to quickly access your applications without fully signing into the dashboard.

First Line of Defense: Shutting Down Your Browser Completely shut down Chrome or Firefox. (Please DO NOT simply click the red ' x ' as this does not completely shut down the browser.) Often, this will fix the issue without having to lose any of your browser history. If the issue resolves, you can stop at this step. If it appears to only be impacting the experience in Chrome, clear your browsing data for at least 7 days in Chrome settings. (You can go back further if needed as shown below.) If clearing the cache doesn’t seem to resolve the issue, try rebooting your computer. In the top right of your Chrome browser, look for a small Okta icon Click on the icon for the dropdown menu. Click the person icon here and you should see your account listed. Click on the link to open a new connection and log in. Note: This toolbar icon for the Okta Chrome extension is a quick way to access all of your apps. We do recommend that you sign in first. This Okta Chrome extension allows you to sign in once and you will not be prompted to sign in for the rest of your day. Preventative Medicine In order to prevent this from happening again, be sure to check the Keep me signed in option. Make sure your Chrome browser is up to date. Sometimes you may see an icon in the upper right hand corner letting you know a Relaunch is needed. Please do not ignore these update messages for an extended period of time. These patches often times fix known bug issues and also reduces our security exposure with vulnerabilities. Even if you do not see this label, often times updates are still needed. You can check that by going to /Settings / About Chrome. ( See also, documentation of steps from Google .) Once you have cleared your cache and ensured all updates are applied. Close any open tabs you have open for Simplifi’s Okta page and then reopen at http://login.simpli.fi/ . If Chrome is still having issues, Safari or Firefox will work with out any issues.

If anything needs to change on your email, begin by contacting the Digital Workplace Solutions ( ) team about the change. And we will coordinate with you on an ideal day and time for your schedule. Applications Requiring Manual Steps from You There are a few apps that Okta doesn't manage that you would have to update on your end (if you used your gotoadvantage.com account originally for these). Some examples of apps that are not connected with Okta: Rippling (most people use their personal email to log into this anyway) HSA if applicable (related to Rippling; it is recommended to use your personal email) Fidelity (most people use their personal email for this as well) AppleID (if applicable; not everyone has a Macbook or signed up for Apple App Store) IcePanel (if applicable) Bitwarden (if applicable; it is preferred for you to change your email in the settings so as not to lose any personal use of Bitwarden for passwords.) Browserstack (if applicable, will assist in changing logins for developers) Any app integrations you use for Atlassian ( Jira / Confluence ) need to be re-authorized with the Simpli.fi account. You will be prompted to do so when clicking into a relevant app (e.g., Google Sheets, Scribehow) Outlook (if you use Outlook, please update your Gmail settings accordingly to send from both email accounts). Once logged into Gmail website in your browser, go to the settings gear for user email change) Current Status of User Accounts Transitioned from gotoadvantage Domain In the fourth quarter of 2023, a decision was made to update all gotoadvantage accounts to simpli.fi email domains. This was in part for seamless login experience for the user (fewer credential combinations to maintain, or discrepancies between Okta logins). It was also prioritized due to the pending change from Rippling HRIS to UKG HRIS, effective January 1, 2024. To review current status and scheduled day/time of changes for employees on your team, please see this spreadsheet and related Jira Task .", "url": "https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/3969908740/Okta+Login+Email+Changes", "metadata": {"source": "confluence", "space": "DW", "space_name": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "page_id": "3969908740", "version": 8, "last_modified": "2023-12-19T21:28:16.422Z", "author": "Ashley Graham", "ancestors": [{"id": "3473048177", "title": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3492511763", "title": "Simplifi Employee Technical Guides", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3621290012", "title": "Okta", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3627122699", "title": "Okta Troubleshooting Guides", "type": "page"}], "permissions": {"read_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "update_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "is_restricted": false}, "is_restricted": false}}
{"id": "confluence_4099899421", "title": "The Okta-phant in the Room", "content": "Sure, there’s no such thing as an Okta-phant. But on the Digital Workplace team, we understand that whenever Okta is mentioned, it garners an exhausted eye-roll from some and trepidatious avoidance from others. We hear you. We get it. We believe it’s our job to listen and make it better for all Simpli.fi users. You’ll never hear us claim that Okta is perfect. But it does have some benefits: Just last quarter Okta prevented and blocked over 200 threat actors. We have saved ~100K since its implementation in license reductions and mistaken assignments. Onboarding efforts reduced significantly (estimated 95% speed-up in application assignments) Even if you do not feel these benefits in your day-to-day, there are a few things we can recommend to make Okta helpful. What follows are some tips for making Okta work for you... Logging into Okta with a Touch You may have seen my reference to in the Digital Workplace channel . It’s true! You can log into Okta without having to check your phone for a code. Simply follow the instructions in the aforementioned article, and you, too, can enter Okta with a quick touch. Please note, the instructions are catered toward Macbook TouchID setup. However, if you would like Windows Hello for the purposes of biometric authentication, you can work with the Digital Workplace Desktop Support Sub-team to obtain that functionality. Auto-launching Applications in Okta Okta works best if you log into it directly from simpli.okta.com at the beginning of your day. So when you’re sipping your first cuppa, log into Okta. We’ve set the session limit for the portal to last beyond your eight hour work day. If you’re logged in there first, you shouldn’t have to log into each of your applications in separate browser tabs. (Some notable exceptions to this are applications, like UKG, that log users out after an hour of activity due to privacy concerns). If you don’t enjoy clicking the Okta tiles, you can auto-launch applications of your choosing each time you log into the Okta portal. That additionally applies for any web apps you store in Okta tile password management, or . (That’s right, ‘there’s a tile for that' if you want it--not just apps that Simpli.fi manages.) Using the Okta Chrome Extension If you want to feel like an Okta power user or hate clicks in general, the Okta Chrome Extension is for you. It has been automatically added to every employee’s Chrome browser. With a simple COMMAND + SHIFT + O , you can begin typing the name of the application you’re wanting to access, hit ENTER and voilà! Improving Employee Experience through Okta Workflows We know employees may not understand the behind-the-scenes work that Okta does in provisioning applications. If we’re doing our jobs, you won’t even think about it. However, as a peek behind the curtain, we can share that: Okta Workflows automate nearly every event-based application update. As one recent example, Kaitlin Purdham used an Okta workflow to provide UKG attributes to the Slack API. Now you can see your colleagues' place in the org chart , their manager, their direct reports (if applicable), their official title, and their start date--all from with an application where you spend most of your time. (Fun fact: thanks to this attribute mapping, your Slack profile now throws you a party on your work anniversary!) We have dozens of Okta workflows to provide the personalized touches that enhance your experience. In short, if there’s an Okta-oddity thwarting your optimal workflow, don’t suffer in silence. If there’s an idea you have to improve operational efficiencies, let us know. Chances are, there’s something further we could do (with Okta) to improve your digital workplace.", "url": "https://simplifi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DW/pages/4099899421/The+Okta-phant+in+the+Room", "metadata": {"source": "confluence", "space": "DW", "space_name": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "page_id": "4099899421", "version": 12, "last_modified": "2024-02-23T17:37:39.253Z", "author": "Ashley Graham", "ancestors": [{"id": "3473048177", "title": "Digital Workplace Solutions", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3492511763", "title": "Simplifi Employee Technical Guides", "type": "page"}, {"id": "3621290012", "title": "Okta", "type": "page"}], "permissions": {"read_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "update_restrictions": {"users": [], "groups": []}, "is_restricted": false}, "is_restricted": false}}
